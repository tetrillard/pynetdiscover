pynetdiscover
=============

pyNetdiscover is an active/passive address reconnaissance tool, ARP Scanner.

Inspired by the C tool Netdiscover http://nixgeneration.com/~jaime/netdiscover/

I just wanted to play with python and a little bit scapy and I didn't want to recompile netdiscover with an updated OUI list.

**Work in progress**

Requirements
============
- python2.7
- scapy
- argparse
- netaddr

optional: oui.txt from http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/oui/oui.txt
